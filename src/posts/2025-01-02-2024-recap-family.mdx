This year has brought me a sense of stability in term of work and family. One of the most memorable events of 2024 was my
trip to Vietnam.

After living in Canada for 6 years, I finally visited my family. I felt reconnection when I had a chance to meet many people
that I had nearly forgotten about. Also, I witnessed how much had changed in my home country from buildings, road and people.

2024 also brought me many moments when I see my former coworkers and friends lose their job, that made me question myself about
stability and resilience.

From coding perspectives, I have done a lot. I publicly launched 2 new projects using Next.js. One of them is a [SaaS project](http://feedback.congdv.com), which
taught me about valuable lessons about database design, user features, and challenges when develops SaaS product. The
other is a [simpler web application](http://stubify.congdv.com) designed for my sister business.

Here are some highlights:

- Travel to Vietnam
- Launched 2 projects
- Moved to new city and new apartment
